/*
var mongoose = require('mongoose');

Here add your database connection then export the variable you made

e.g:
var db = mongoose.connect('mongoose://localhost:{port}/{your DB name}', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });
db connection created successfully!

PS: 
    - Here the {port} variable you specified when you're creating your mongodb database.
    - Then the next variable is the db name. 

Then tou need to export it  
e.g:   
    module.exports = db;
